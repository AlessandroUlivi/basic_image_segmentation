    "The present pipeline allows to perform a semantic segmentation of 1 channel. It was conceptualized for CYK1::GFP. Refer to the ACR005 transgenic C. elegans line for background information on the transgenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline have been developed and tested on time-lapse images of the C.elegans embryo cortex. The embryo was imaged between the 2 and the 6 cells stages. Images were acquired, live, at a Nikon CSU-X1 spinning disk microscope at IGMBC Strasbourg, using a 100x, 1.4 NA, oil immersion objective (pixel size xy 0.11 um).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline works on 3D arrays. It was conceptualized for processing a single plane (the embryonic cortical plane) imaged over time. Thus, the segmentation masks are obtained by iterating 2D segmentations methods along one of the 3 axes of the input arrays. When the pipeline was created this corresponded to the time-dimension of the time-lapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly work the pipeline requires an existing input folder (input_folder) containg the a single 3D arrays to process. It is not possible to have additional files in the input folder. The pipeline was conceptualized so that the array is the time-lapse for the two cyk1::gfp structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an ROI is used for segmentation, the iteration axis must be on position 0 of the input file shape. For example, when the pipeline was created this corresponded to the time-axis and the files had dimensions order TYX. Different dimension orders are NOT possible at the moment if a ROI is provided for segmentation because the reference image passed to form_mask_from_roi when creating embryo_roi_mask is at position 0 of the ch_timecourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is required to provide an output folder. The output folder must exist. The output folder can contain files. The outputs of the pipeline are saved in the output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the pipeline are:\n",
    "1) Binary segmentation mask for ch1 3D array. Refer to section SEGMENTATION OF CH1 - CYK1GFP ENRICHED STRUCTURES.\n",
    "2) A binary segmentation mask corresponding to the emrbyo cortex. Refer to section SEGMENTATION OF EMBRYO CORTEX.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating output 2, it is possible to restrict the segmentation to one or more regions of interest (ROIs) of the input 3D array. In this case, the ROIs must be provided as a single file (.roi or .zip) contained in a folder (following roi_path variable). Nothing else but the file must be present in the folder. The procedure is conceptualized for the use of ROI files created in ImageJ/Fiji.\n",
