    "The present pipeline allows to perform a semantic segmentation of 1 channel. It was conceptualized to segment C. elegans embryo, imaged at the cortical plane, from background pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the pipeline was developed the embryo was imaged between the 1 and the 6 cells stage. C. elegans cortex was labelled with fluorescent dyes (fusion proteins) and imaged by means of microscopy techniques for fluorescence imaging. Precisely, the pipeline have been developed and tested on time-lapse images acquired, live, at a Nikon CSU-X1 spinning disk microscope at IGMBC Strasbourg, using a 100x, 1.4 NA, oil immersion objective (pixel size xy 0.11 um).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline works on 3D arrays. It was conceptualized for processing a single plane (the embryonic cortical plane) imaged over time. Thus, the segmentation masks are obtained by iterating 2D segmentations methods along one of the 3 axes of the input arrays. When the pipeline was created this corresponded to the time-dimension of the time-lapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly work the pipeline requires an existing input folder (input_folder) containg a single 3D arrays to process. It is not possible to have additional files in the input folder. The iteration axis must be in position 0 of the 3D array to process. When the pipeline was created this corresponded to the time-axis and the inputs had dimensions TYX.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is required to provide an output folder. The output folder must exist. The output folder can contain files. The outputs of the pipeline are saved in the output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the pipeline are:\n",
    "1) A binary segmentation mask of the same shape of the input 3D array. By default the output dtype is np.uin8 and values 0 and 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to restrict the segmentation to one or more regions of interest (ROIs) of the input 3D array. In this case, the ROIs must be provided as a single file (.roi or .zip) contained in a folder. Nothing else but the file must be present in the folder. The directory of the folder must be indicated in the variable roi_path. If the ROI should be used for segmentation the variable use_roi_for_segmentation must be set to True. The procedure is conceptualized for the use of ROI files created in ImageJ/Fiji.\n"

    "11) Individual regions of THRESH_IMG(i) are groups of connected pixels with the same intensity value and completely sourranded by backgroung pixels. Refer to https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.label . Individual regions of each 2D THRESH_IMG(i) along the iteration axis are filered using a highpass filter. The value of the highpass filter (in number of pixels) is defined in the variable embryo_highpass_area_threshold. Only regions whose area is >embryo_highpass_area_threshold are maintained.
